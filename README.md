# DataAnalysis_Healthcare_Using_SQL

This project contains **15 SQL problem statements** related to healthcare data, insurance, pharmacies, and treatment records.  
Each problem is solved using optimized SQL queries that highlight skills in **data extraction, aggregation, joins, filtering, and reporting**.  


## Problem Domains  

The problem set covers:  
- Patient demographics (age, gender, households)  
- Disease and treatment trends  
- Insurance plans and claim analysis  
- Pharmacy inventory, prescriptions, and taxes  
- State and city-wise healthcare analysis
